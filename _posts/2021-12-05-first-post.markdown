This is my first post to this shiny new website, my first post to a Jekyll page, and my first post written in markdown!

Some of these terms probably make more sense if you're into web development (especially open source), but if you're not, worry not!  There will be many posts tagged with the "nontechnical" category if you want to avoid the nerd-speak.

If you're here exclusively for the nerd-speak, you already know how all this works and I don't need to hold your hand through a Jekyll site :wink:
